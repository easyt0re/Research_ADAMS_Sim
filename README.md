This is just a log for my work in ADAMS Simulation. It helps me keep track of things

initiate this directory

save **new_motion.bin** as **new_ang_measure.bin**

try to have fixed def for angle's direction and bias 

the goal was to switch the splines only and the simulation worked correctly

change the measures to function measurements, f(t)

**TODO:** 	automate this whole process

			try to figure out the torque_measuremnets on motors

			if possible, does that mean F/T on TCP is also possible?
